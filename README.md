# spinApp
A profile builder for Spinning(R) instructors

## Background problem, "business case"

Spinning is a group exercise format where participants simulate an outdoor road cycling experience indoors. Spinning instructors need to pre-plan their class to provide the best & safest possible training for their participants. Instructors can use special signs (icons) in their notes to indicate movements used throughout a Spinning class. This way, they don't need to write that much when preparing. All Spinning instructors know the meaning of these signs (ie. "flat road", "standing on a hill", etc.). 

In spinApp, they can quickly create their profiles with a drag'n'drop builder. A new row in the app means a new song in their playlist for the given class. The profile is printable when ready.
